A complete spin of 'drum' will produce an advance of 0.50 mm and the fifty divisions will ‘sweep’ the ‘reference line’. In this way, each division of the drum ‘marks’ the advance of 0.01 mm (one hundredth of a millimeter) of the spindle.

To interact with the micrometer simulation, you can

drag the drum vertically using mouse to rotate
drag instrument by dragging other than 'drum' part
use mouse wheel or arrow keys to advance the drum
adjust zero error from -0.40mm to 0.40mm using slider
scale the micrometer to view divisions more clearly using slider
